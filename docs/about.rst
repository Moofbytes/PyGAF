About PyGAF
===========

The simple concept behind PyGAF is to provide an interface for evaluation and display of analytic solutions for groundwater flow (also referred to as closed-form solutions). Solutions are pre-coded within the package and methods are provided for evaluating the solutions and visualising results using a variety of outputs, including contours plots, graphs and tables.

The package is designed to be useful for simple practical applications of the solutions to real-world situations and for learning and teaching about groundwater flow concepts and theory. Methods are provided for displaying reference information about eachy solution, including the conceptual model and assumptions, and for displaying cartoons of the conceptual model. Jupyter notebooka are available from GitHub for each solution class to demonstrate their use.

It is hoped is to grow the library of solutions over time. Contributors to the project are most welcome!
